Hi I'm Matt Brandt, a QA Engineer at Mozilla - I work for the Fox. I'm a lead
engineer on several of our web properties.

I hold two undergraduate degrees; one in Psychology and another in
Software Engineering. Prior to joining Mozilla I worked at IBM's
Boulder campus as an automation lead. I've followed many different
careers in life; a counselor for adjudicated youth, working in health
clinics in Central America, and even squeezing tofu in a factory.

When I'm not at work I'm most likely seeking solitude in the mountains of 
California or moonlighting on other open sources projects under a pseudonym.

I've found myself at an interesting crossroads in life where I've been
empowered to facilitate conversations surrounding quality that result in
better team and end user experiences.
