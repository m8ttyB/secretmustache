Hi I'm Matt Brandt, a QA Engineer at `Mozilla`_. Currently I am
a lead on several of our website projects: `input.mozilla.com`_,
`crash-stats.mozilla.com`_, `mozillians.org`_, and 
`affiliates.mozilla.org`_.

I hold two undergraduate degrees; one in Psychology and another in
Software Engineering. Prior to joining Mozilla I worked at IBM's
Boulder campus as an automation lead. I've followed many different
careers in life; a counselor for adjudicated youth, working in health
clinics in Central America, and even worked in a factory squeezing tofu
at one point when I was dirt-bag climber living out of a '69 VW
Campmobile (*my 1st paying QA job!*).

When I'm not at work I'm most likely seeking solitude in the mountains of 
California or moonlighting on other open sources projects under a pseudonym.

I've found myself at an interesting crossroads in life where I've been
empowered to facilitate conversations surrounding quality that result in
better team and end user experiences.

If you'd like to contact me, email me at mbrandt at mozilla.com.
