A love note to freecog.com

This isn't actually a eulogy .. I just wanted to show `Alex`_ some
visuals on the hardware that is running freecog.com. I've run my primary
site from this little beast for years (previously on a PII box running
FreeBSD).  It wasn't a problem until I started working at Mozilla. I now
get enough page hits that the lights dim at my apartment and the special
lady friend, my partner, complains that the Internets noticeably slow. 
This happens whenever I submit a post and more than a handful of people
decide to read it.

I'm keeping the box and
domain for dev/play purposes (no you can't have the domain name ...
unless you want to swap something fun for it ... I do like good beer
from foreign countries or chew toys for my cat). I originally snagged
the domain when I was a Psychology geek, Freecog == free cognition. I
had the lofty goal of blogging about cognitive neuroscience.  At least
for for the time being life has spun me into the domain of computer
science. Specs:

-  `Asus Eee PC 1000H`_
-  1.7 GHz Intel Atom processor
-  2 gigs of ram
-  180 gig harddrive
-  Ubuntu Server 11.10
-  `Dyndns`_
