What a motivating and inspirational year this has been; continued involvement
in the open source communities surrounding Mozilla, moving back to Colorado,
having our `first child`_ [`1`_], and now this trip.

After a year of planning, I leave in a week and a half for Argentina to join
a small group of climbers, 7 in total. We’ll spend roughly 3 weeks climbing
in the Andes; specifically our objective is to climb `Aconcagua`_ whose summit
sits at 22,841 ft (6,962 m).

I've been out of the high altitude climbing scene for almost a decade. I'm
thrilled to be back and overjoyed to be joining `KMG`_ on this trip.
I've known Josh Kling (the owner) and several of the other team members
for quite some time. This will be a reunion with friends both old and new.

The Route
---------

The route that we are taking, Folso De Los Polaco 360, circumnavigates
Aconcagua and provides a variety of new terrain and views throughout the
entirety of the trip. The climb begins by trekking up the Vacas and Relinchos
valleys where mules will porter our food and equipment to our base camp at
13,780 ft. 

From base camp onwards our group will climb the mountain, ferrying supplies to
higher camps as we get acclimated until we are in a position to make our summit
bid. All told we'll have 3 additonal camps above 13,780 ft before our bid.

After summiting we descend the opposite side of the mountain to Plaza de Mulas,
trekking out the Horcones valley.

[Semi-]Live Updates
-------------------

Our external communications to the world during the trip will be fairly limited.
*KMG* is bringing a satiliate phone to send out updates and for the rare event of
an emergency. Several times during the trip updates will be passed back to the
USA where they will be posted to Facebook - `Kling Mountain Guides`_. Updates will
be rare and low-bandwith, no update is a good update.

Equipment

As you might imagine an undertaking of this magnitude means a lot of planning
as well as the need for lots of shiny, fun equipment. The climb itself will
travel through a wide temperature range; the trek in is relatively warm, as we
progress up the mountain we'll slowly begin piling on more and more layers.

For a full list of equipment here is my `gear list`_. For those who
have future ambitions of climbing Acongagua I'm happy to chat with you post-trip
about what worked and didn't work for this trip.

Research for this trip was greatly aided by what I could scour off of the
equipment lists of others and tips from *KMG*, I hope my list is helpful. Note
I've not included group gear on the list, I'll post one once we return.

Very simply a big thank you to my partner, Erin, for helping me realize and
chase after this goal. It would've been a big year without
including this trip. 

Thank you for supporting me with my [sometimes bordering on] obsurd
workout schedule of crossfit, running, climbing, and mountain biking (my guilty
pleasure). It's been a full year.
