Thank You
---------
Firstly, I wanted to profoundly thank the Mozilla community for the incredible
response and support that you expressed when we put out the `call for help`_
to do exploratory testing on the `Mozillians project`_.

The number and quality of bugs filed (`54`_) within the short timeframe of a few
weeks has been nothing short of overwhelming. The community has helped identify
conversations that stress usability. These conversations are informing the next
generation of `UX`_ that the team is working on.

I've whole-heartily enjoyed speaking with you in `IRC`_, `email`_, and `Bugzilla`_. To
be quite honest your feedback has swamped our small team! This is something to
be celebrated! Thank you! 

Next Steps: Phase 3
-------------------
The Mozillians project is entering `Phase 3`_ which represents a massive
site-wide overhaul.

  "Contributors and staff alike mention the difficulty for potential contributors
  to get started in contributing to Mozilla. There is no easy way to find a
  finite contribution to perform without having to go through, on average, 3
  click-throughs via on normal contributor channels (i.e. Mozilla Newsletter,
  Get Involved, etc.). The aim of this milestone is to deliver a set of
  solutions to increase the likelihood of participation from potential and
  new contributors." ~ `Phase 3`_

Phase 3 includes:

* `Privacy Controls`_
* `New Profile Fields`_
* `Display Badges On Profiles`_
* `Allow Restricted Group Membership`_
* `Improve Profile Editing UX`_
* `Improve Profiles UX`_
* `Improve Sign-Up Flow`_
* `Site Banner`_
* `Improve Groups UX`_

Over the course of the next several weeks the team will begin creating the next
iteration of Mozillians after which we'll engage the community again for an 
in-depth round of focused exploratory testing.

Staying Involved
----------------
Many of our web projects ebb and flow at varying rates. While the Mozillians
project is in a state of focused calm you can continue to stay involved; first
through `manual testing`_ on our other web properties and second by helping
with `test automation`_.

There is an third option. If the Mozillians project runs strong in your
veins I am willing to mentor a single individual who *may become the proxy
lead*. The project currently needs help with new feature testing as well as
assistance with the weekly releases. 

I am looking for an individual who is willing to learn as well as actively help me
creatively push the project forward. This is something that only a person who
strongly enjoys being a `QA`_ (Quality Advocate) can do. You must be able to commit
3 - 4 hours per week.

If this interests you come talk to me in `IRC`_ in the `#commtools`_ or `#mozwebqa`_
channels. My nick is mbrandt. I am typically online 8am - 5pm `UTC/GMT -8 hours`_
Monday - Friday. You can also reach through `email`_.

See you online!
