    He was a wanderer on a prehistoric earth, on an earth that
    wore the aspect of an unknown planet.
    But time is the fire in which we burn. We are but a
    fleeting moment, a footprint at the edge of the rising tide.

I am having a quiet evening tonight shuffling through imagery and 
thoughts of my past and wondering what is next. I didn't sit down 
tonight with the intent to write this. It just felt right. It felt 
like it was time to let go and time to move forward. This post is 
for me. Finally.

Much time has passed since I've felt the healthy untethering of my
thoughts and a full awakening of a past spirit that was a constant 
flame in my life. A lot of personal healing and strength over the
years is culminating and reveling itself in these next moments of my 
life.

Years have past - 8+ of them - I was young. I had seen lot's of
suffering in the world, worked in 3rd world clinics, worked with
displaced children living on the streets, led educational trips to
Latin America to try to teach my generation that our way of life
in the United States is one experience. I was enthusiastic and high
spirited. I lived a fully present life and because of that the world
opened to me.

I had seen hope and prosperity in the most unbelievable places and
moments. At one point I traveled for 2 years and lived out of a
backpack with the simple intent of experiencing the world and it's
humanity. I followed an education and career into human services. I
chose Psychology and had the desire of doing undergraduate work in
Cognitive Neuroscience. That all changed. Only a few close friends and 
family members followed me through the fire or remember me from before. 

    I want to be remembered as a woman who tried. Remember me for my
    failures. I have no control over my successes, that is in the hands
    of others. I want to be remembered for the times I tried and failed,
    for the times I tried, kept trying, wouldn't give up, and failed.
    ~ my grandmother

At the time I had made my home an isolated corner of South Western
Colorado working as a councilor at a juvenile detention facility. 
I worked with children whom were barely hanging on as the system and 
often their own families eroded their hope for a future. I tried to
make a difference.

One evening I watched my supervisor hurt a child and reported him to
his superiors. I was later terminated because I wouldn't change the 
incident report that I had written, I wouldn't repress a statement 
the child had made, he had fingered the supervisor as an abuser.
Once the State found out about the incident the agency tried to protect 
itself through subterfuge and reported that I had failed to report the
abuse to them. I was unemployable, because of the circumstances I would
never be allowed to work with children again. I was destroyed.

I sold most of my worldly possessions (mostly outdoor equipment) so I 
wouldn't become homeless and took menial temp jobs. I sold items and 
let go of dreams that were my identity.

I fought using the court system for over 5 years to have my name
cleared so I could continue to empower and embolden the children
I wanted to work with. I fought and failed. I fought and lost myself
along the way. I fought and found someone who I now remember from my 
past. I now have more miles on my body but have the same vibrant
energy as before.

My intent isn't to relive the nuances of the story. It isn't what I
want to let go of, because of my story I now do the work that I 
do, I work in Open Source, I interact with talented and passionate people 
across the globe real-time on a daily basis, I solve hard technical 
problems, I am empowered to push technology and people's imaginations
forward, I am helping write history and make the world better. I don't 
imagine leaving a place like Mozilla anytime soon but again this is
only one small part of my story.
