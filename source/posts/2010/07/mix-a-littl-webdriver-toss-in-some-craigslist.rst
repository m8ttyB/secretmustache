Mix a little WebDriver toss in some CraigsList

A while ago I caught a wild hair to create a program to scrape
CraigsList for tech jobs. `Chris McMahon`_, fellow friend and creative
QA extraordinaire is credited with turning me onto this idea. He
created essentially the same script but in ruby, what a crazy simple
notion.  I tend to spend most of time in Python so I thought I'd jump
ship back to my Java roots and try my hand at my own implementation.

I'll be honest... I was shocked at how reliant I've become on Python's
built-in libraries and how much Java I've forgotten. This was a super
fun side project and I bet I'll toss it into use. As I add updates to
the code (this was my first draft) I'll make the code available for
download.

Take a peek at the code here: `download code`_
