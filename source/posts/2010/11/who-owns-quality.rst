Lately I've been fielding this question quite a bit at work and frankly
its getting a bit exhausting to answer. I've become the automated test 
czar and thus all support, maintenance, and failings of our currently frameworks,
harnesses, and tools are filtered in my direction. OK, I'm joking a bit
here but at times I can feel the burning stare of colleagues eyes when
they're talking about the state of testing and the quality issues that
nip us from time to time. You may be on the other side of the boat, but
when theres a leak on my side don't forget we're still in the same boat
together.

I'm going to *blatantly* steal a blurb from Alan Page's
blog, `Angry Weasel`_. `Lisa Crispin`_ is credited with pointing me in
the articles direction.

"Many years ago when I would ask the question, “who owns quality,” the
answer would nearly always be “The test team owns quality.” Today, when
I ask this question, the answer is customarily “Everyone owns quality.”
While this may be a better answer to some, W. Mark Manduke of SEI has
written: “When quality is declared to be everyone’s responsibility, no
one is truly designated to be responsible for it, and quality issues
fade into the chaos of the crisis du jour.” He concluded that “…when
management truly commits to a quality culture, everyone will, indeed, be
responsible for quality.”(STQE Magazine. Nov/Dec 2003 (Vol. 5, Issue
6))"
