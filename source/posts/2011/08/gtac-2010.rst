I just returned from a great trip to Hyderabad, India for this year's
Google Test Automation Conference. An inspiring trip where I spent
several days getting test-geek on with a room full of other very
passionate testers.

Some of the tools and methodologies that I picked up at the conference
will be interesting to see where I can apply them to the print-workflow
industry. More curiously I'm looking forward to the collaboration
opportunities from my new cross-continent contacts.
