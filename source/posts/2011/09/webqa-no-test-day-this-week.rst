Hello all,

A late update for tomorrows WebQA hosted test day, Friday 9.9.11.  WebQA
won't be hosting a test day this week. I had planned on a day of working
to expand the Selenium coverage on `Socorro`_ (aka Breakpad ... aka
Crashstats).  Of the many reasons I can think of it mainly comes down to
I've been overrun with work and can't sustainably host this tomorrow. 
This is not to say that the backlog of tests to be automated is small,
in fact with the help of `Tobias Markus`_ (our wonderful intern) it has
ceaselessly grown as he's dug through the existing testcases during his
gap analysis.

I'm absolutely encouraged by the amount of interesting testcases that
could use automation and look forward to having a formal testing day
arranged for this project soon.

Project links
-------------

-  Test stories in `Pivotal Tracker`_ to be automated
-  irc channels: `#breakpad`_ and our general webqa hangout `#mozwebqa`_

I look forward to seeing you at future test days and on the irc
channels. Feel free to pop in at anytime and say hello.
