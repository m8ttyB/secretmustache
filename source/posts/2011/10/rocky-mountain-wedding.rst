Erin and I just returned from a great trip to Durango, Colorado for her
brother's wedding. Durango is one of my favorite places in the United
States. It's located in the South West portion of Colorado and has both
mountains and desert. At one point in my life I lived here, spending 10
years exploring and playing in this area. There is lots of hiking,
biking, and climbing in this remote portion of the the state.
