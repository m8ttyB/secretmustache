Of the adventures and life events that I've had the fortune
to be a part of and experience this latest one is without a doubt
turning out to be great. Daily I am stunned by the diverse passions and
skills of the community of people who surround Mozilla, not to mention
the excellent projects that I’m on (oh... and the free coffee). The coffee
bit is a novelty to me at previous employers the staff have had to pool
their money together to buy items like a coffee pot and a fridge (for our lunches).

I’m transitioning in as the QA lead on the `Input`_ and `Socorro`_
projects. These projects are built around the simple notion of
aggregating, setting free, and making information useful.

The `Input`_ project aggregates user submitted feedback of Firefox.
`Socorro`_ is a collection pot for information from gathered when Firefox,
Thunderbird, ... plus several other projects crash.

Feel free to wet your appetite by poking around these projects.
