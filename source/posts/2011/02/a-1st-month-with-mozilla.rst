Of the adventures and life events (`a few`_) that I've had the fortune
to be a part of and experience this latest one is without a doubt
turning out to be great.  Daily I am stunned by the diverse passions and
skills of the community of people who surround Mozilla, not to mention
the excellent projects that I’m on (oh... and the free coffee).

I’m transitioning in as the QA lead on the `Input`_ and `Socorro`_
projects.  These projects are built around the simple notion of
aggregating, setting free, and making information useful.

The Input project aggregates user submitted feedback of Firefox. 
Socorro is a collection pot for information from crash reports.

Feel free to wet your appetite by poking around these projects:

Input
~~~~~

-  `source code`_ & `automated tests`_ & `litmus tests`_
-  `project overview`_

Socorro
~~~~~~~

-  `source code`_ & `automated tests`_ & `litmus tests`_
-  `project overview`_

\*\* As always if anyone is interested in getting involved in any of the
test efforts within the Mozilla community feel free to drop me a line
and I'll do my best to help get you started.
